# TrainScheduler
Visit https://jenntuten.github.io/TrainScheduler/ for a preview.\
\
This app incorporates Firebase and Moment.js to provide up-to-date train schedule information and save user data.\
\
When the page loads, the data from Firebase is displayed, allowing the user to view up-to-date train times and add their own. \
\
Using Moment.js, the app calculates these times based on the 'First Train Time' that the user enters. Whenever the page loads, the app displays the next arrival time and minutes away for each train.
