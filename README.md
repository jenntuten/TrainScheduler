# TrainScheduler
Visit https://jenntuten.github.io/TrainScheduler/ for a preview.\
\
This app incorporates Firebase and Moment.js to provide up-to-date train schedule information and save user data.\
\
When the page loads, the data from Firebase is displayed, allowing the user to view up-to-date train times and add their own. Multiple users can access this app from different machines.\
\
Using Moment.js, the app calculates the next arrival time and minutes away for each train. This data is calculated based on the 'First Train Time' that the user enters.
